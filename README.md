## 🚧 Featured Projects 

**Airbnb Instant booking predictor** 

Projects Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning classification model to predict whether an Airbnb listing is “Instant Bookable” based on host activity, guest reviews, and listing characteristics. The goal is to help improve booking efficiency and user experience by identifying key factors that influence instant booking availability.

### Key Features & Results

- **Binary Classification**: Developed Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models to classify Airbnb listings as instant bookable or not using structured listing data  
- **Feature Engineering**: Handled missing values through median imputation, removed low-variance features, and applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables  
- **Model Tuning & Selection**: Used GridSearchCV and SelectKBest to optimize hyperparameters and identify top predictive features, achieving a test accuracy of 75.4%  
- **Model Evaluation**: Compared models using AUC, accuracy, and log loss metrics; visualized performance using ROC curves  
- **Key Insights**: Found guest review metrics and host response behavior to be strong predictors of instant bookabilityy

## Other projecrs

 **Mancala C++ game**  
 
 Projects Overview
This project is a fully interactive, two-player console-based implementation of the classic board game Mancala, developed in C++ using object-oriented programming principles. The gameplay logic, state management, and win conditions are encapsulated within dedicated classes, providing a clean, modular structure for scalability and maintainability. The game simulates real Mancala rules, allowing two players to take alternating turns, redistribute stones, skip opponent stores, and determine a winner based on final scores. The system ensures robust input validation and continuously displays the current game state after each move.
